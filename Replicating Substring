Replicating Substring

Given a string B, find if it is possible to re-order the characters of the string B so that it can be represented as a concatenation of A similar strings.

Eg: B = aabb and A = 2, then it is possible to re-arrange the string as "abab" which is a concatenation of 2 similar strings "ab".

If it is possible, return 1, else return -1.

Input 1: A = 2 B = "bbaabb" Output 1: 1 Explanation 1: We can re-order the given string into "abbabb".
Input 2: A = 1 B = "bc" Output 2: 1 Explanation 2: String "bc" is already arranged.

int solve(int A, string B) {
    map<char, int> M;
    for(auto b : B){
        M[b]++;
    }
    for(auto m : M){
        if(m.second % A != 0) return -1;
    }
    return 1;
}
