Subsequence-Sum Problem

You are given an array of integers of N size.
You have to find that there is any subsequence exists or not whose sum is equal to B.

Example Input
Input 1: A=[1,20,13,4,5] B=18 Output: 1 There is as subsequence present at indexes 1,3,4 whose sum is 18
Input 2: A=[2,2,2,2] B=5 Output: 0 There is no possible subsequence whose sum is 5

int solve(vector<int> &A, int B) {
    int sum = 0;
    
    for(auto a : A){
        sum += a;
        if(sum == B) return 1;
        
        if(sum > B) sum -= a;
    }
    return 0;
}

//TC : O(n) SC : O(1)
