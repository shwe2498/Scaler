Leap year?

Given an integer A representing an year, Return 1 if it is a leap year else return 0.

A year is leap year if the following conditions are satisfied:

Year is multiple of 400.
Year is multiple of 4 and not multiple of 100.

Input 1: A = 2020 Output 1: 1 Explanation 1: 2020 is a leap year.
Input 2: A = 1999 Output 2: 0 Explanation 2: 1999 is not a leap year.

int solve(int A) {
    return ((A % 400 == 0) || ((A % 4 == 0) && (A % 100 != 0))) ? 1 : 0;
}
