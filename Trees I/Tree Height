Tree Height
You are given the root node of a binary tree A. You have to find the height of the given tree.

A binary tree's height is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
Input 1:
 Values =  1 
          / \     
         4   3                        
Output 1:  2
Explanation 1:
 Distance of node having value 1 from root node = 1
 Distance of node having value 4 from root node = 2 (max)
 Distance of node having value 3 from root node = 2 (max)
 
Input 2:
 Values =  1      
          / \     
         4   3                       
        /         
       2                
Output 2: 3 
Explanation 2:
 Distance of node having value 1 from root node = 1
 Distance of node having value 4 from root node = 2
 Distance of node having value 3 from root node = 2
 Distance of node having value 2 from root node = 3 (max)
