Shaggy and distances
Shaggy has an array A consisting of N elements. We call a pair of distinct indices in that array as a special pair if elements at that index in the array are equal.

Shaggy wants you to find a special pair such that distance between that pair is minimum. Distance between two indices is defined as |i-j|. If there is no special pair in the array then return -1.

int solve(vector<int> &A) {
    map<int, int> M;
    int min_poss_dist = INT_MAX;

    for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++){
        if(M.find(A[i]) != M.end()){
            min_poss_dist = min(min_poss_dist, i - M[A[i]]);
        }
        M[A[i]] = i;
    }
    if(min_poss_dist == INT_MAX){
        min_poss_dist = -1;
    }
    return min_poss_dist;
}
