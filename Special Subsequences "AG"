Special Subsequences "AG"

You have given a string A having Uppercase English letters.

You have to find that how many times subsequence "AG" is there in the given string.

NOTE: Return the answer modulo 109 + 7 as the answer can be very large.

Input 1: A = "ABCGAG" Output 1: 3 Subsequence "AG" is 3 times in given string 
Input 2: A = "GAB" Output 2: 0 There is no subsequence "AG" in the given string.

int solve(string A) {
    int AGCount = 0;
    int GCount = 0;
    
    for(int a = A.size() - 1; a >= 0; a--){
        if(A[a] == 'G') GCount += 1;
        if(A[a] == 'A') AGCount += GCount;
    }
    
    return AGCount % 10000000007;
}

//TC : O(n) SC : O(1)
