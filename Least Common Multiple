Least Common Multiple

You are given two non-negative integers A and B, find the value of Least Common Multiple (LCM) of A and B.

LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both.
Input 1: A = 2 B = 3 Output 1: 6 Explanation 1: 6 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 2 (2 * 3 = 6) and 3 (3 * 2 = 6).
Input 2: A = 9 B = 6 Output 2: 18 Explanation 2: 18 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 9 (9 * 2 = 18) and 6 (6 * 3 = 18).
Input 3: A = 2 B = 6 Output 3: 6 Explanation 3: 6 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 2 (2 * 3 = 6) and 6 (6 * 1 = 6).

int GCD(int a, int b){
    return (b == 0) ? a : GCD(b, a %b);
}

int LCM(int A, int B) {
    return (A / GCD(A, B)) * B;
}

TC : O(log(max(a,b)) SC : O(log(max(a,b))
