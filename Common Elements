/* Common Elements
Problem Description

Given two integer array A and B of size N and M respectively. Your task is to find all the common elements in both the array.

NOTE:

Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
The result can be in any order.

Input 1:

 A = [1, 2, 2, 1]
 B = [2, 3, 1, 2]
 Output 1:

 [1, 2, 2] */
 
 vector<int> solve(vector<int> &A, vector<int> &B) {
     map<int, int> M;
     vector<int> v;
     
     for(auto a : A){
         M[a]++;
     }
     
     for(auto b : B){
         if(M.find(b) != M.end() && M[b] > 0){
            v.push_back(b);
            M[b]--;
         }
     }
     return v;
}
